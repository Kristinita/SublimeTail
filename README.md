# Tail for Sublime Text

[Tail](http://goo.gl/Pvbmrz) files in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) and [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3).

Right now, there's nothing to see here, since this plugin is not finished yet. If you're curious and like to try it in its alpha stage, have a look at the [devel](https://github.com/vifo/SublimeTail/tree/devel) branch.
